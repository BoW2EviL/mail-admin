# Documentation
[Home](https://mailadminpanel.org/)

This page contains the documentation for configuring and using the mail-admin panel.
All of the user editable files are located in the 'usr/' directory and this directory will contain the admin logs as well as the main configuration file.
It is not recomended to directly edit files that are not in the 'usr/' directory, as this may cause damaged to mail-admin.

## Configuration file

 usr/config.php

 The configuration file can be found in the 'usr/' directory.
 If this file does not exist, then mail-admin will not know how to work with your mail server.
 If you do not have a config file, you will see the following message ***No config file exists. Make a copy of config.sample.php and add your configuration there.***
